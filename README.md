Life outside the Love Island USA villa isn’t exactly drama-free for Kendall Washington.

Kendall went on to thank everyone “for the calls/texts to support me during this time.” He also continued to express gratitude for his experience on Love Island USA.

During the final episode, which aired on Sunday, July 21, Kendall and Nicole Jacky expressed their love for each other after being coupled up for a majority of the season.

“Looking back at the moment we first met, still gives me the chills,” Kendall shared with the California native. “When I heard the sound of your high heels getting closer to me, you then took my blindfold off me. Until this day, I have never laid eyes on something so beautiful.”

He continued, “Nicole Danielle Jacky, when I say these words, I mean them. I love you.”
